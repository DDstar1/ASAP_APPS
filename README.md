# 🚀 ASAP Apps

This repo contains two independent Expo apps — **Customer App** and **Rider App** — located in the same folder but running separately.

---

## 📂 Structure

```
ASAP_APPS/
├── customer_app/     # Customer-facing app
├── rider_app/        # Rider-facing app
├── start-apps.bat    # Windows startup script
├── start-apps.sh     # Mac/Linux startup script
└── README.md
```

Each app has its own **node_modules**, **package.json**, and **Expo config**.

---

## ⚙️ Setup

Install dependencies for both apps:

```bash
cd customer_app && npm install
cd ../rider_app && npm install
```

---

## ▶️ Run Apps

### 🪟 Windows

```bash
start-apps.bat
```

### 🖥️ Mac / Linux

```bash
./start-apps.sh
```

Both scripts will:

- Ask if you want to clear Expo’s cache.
- Launch **Customer App** and **Rider App** in separate terminals.
